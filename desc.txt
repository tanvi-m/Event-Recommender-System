Abstract For decades, Moore's Law dimensional scaling has been the fuel that propelled the computing industry forward, by delivering performance, power and cost advantages with each new generation of silicon. Today, these scaling benefits are slowing to a crawl. If the computing industry wants to continue to make scalability the primary source of value in tomorrow's computing systems, we will have to quickly find new and productive ways to scale future systems. In this talk, I will highlight my work and the work of others that is rejuvenating scaling through the application of heterogeneous parallel designs. Leveraging these technologies to solve the scaling problem will be a significant challenge, as future scalability success will ultimately be less about "how" to do it and more about "how much" will it cost.

Abstract: We introduce the notion of a resource-oblivious parallel algorithm, which is an algorithm designed without any reference to the machine parameters such as number of cores, cache size and block size, or to the run-time scheduler. We present a class of multithreaded resource-oblivious algorithms for which we establish low cache miss and false sharing overhead on multicores with a wide range of machine parameters, as long as the run-time scheduler is efficient in terms of the number of parallel tasks it schedules across the caches. This class includes efficient algorithms with high levels of parallelism for matrix multiplication, FFT, sorting, list ranking, graph connectivity, sequence alignment and other basic problems.

Abstract: Every perceptual and cognitive function in humans is realized by neural population responses evolving over time and space in multiple brain regions. In this talk, I will describe a brain mapping approach that combine magnetoencephalography (MEG), functional MRI (fMRI) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to yield a spatially and temporally integrated characterization of neural representations during visual perception and memorization. Determining the duration and sequencing of cognitive processes at the scale of the whole human brain provides insights to evaluate the computational strategies that may work best for performing specific tasks.

Abstract: Cancer is an evolutionary process driven by somatic mutations that accumulate in a population of cells that form a tumor. In the past few years, high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have enabled the measurement of these mutations across thousands of individual tumors. Despite this wealth of data, our understanding of the cancer mutational landscape remains incomplete. In this talk, I will describe algorithms to identify networks of interacting mutations across cancer patients and to infer the evolution of mutations within a tumor from a single patient. Together these approaches help address key analytical challenges in translating measurements of somatic mutations into deeper insights about the processes that drive cancer development.

Dr. Padhu Seshaiyer, a Program Director at the National Science Foundation, will give a talk on ‚ÄúResearch and Education using STEM based approaches for modeling, analysis and simulation of biological, bio-inspired and engineering systems‚Äù. He will present on Friday, September 29 at 11 am in the NCSA auditorium. Please join us for a brief reception at 10:30 am in the atrium followed by the colloquium in the auditorium. Title: Research and Education using STEM based approaches for modeling, analysis and simulation of biological, bio-inspired and engineering systems Abstract: In the last decade, there have been dramatic advances in our understanding to model, analyze and simulate fundamental mechanisms underlying biological, bio-inspired and engineering systems. Some examples of multidisciplinary applications that arise in such areas include understanding why aneurysms rupture, how zika spreads, modeling micro-air vehicles, studying social dynamics to creating practical solutions to stop poaching of elephants in Africa. Coupled with this research agenda is also a greater need to engage the next generation STEM workforce in such real-world problem solving. In this talk, participants will learn about STEM based research and educational frameworks that not only helps to enhance pedagogical practices of educators but also provides opportunities for students at all levels to engage in multidisciplinary problem solving. Bio: Dr. Padhu Seshaiyer is a tenured Professor of Mathematical Sciences at George Mason University and serves as the Director of the STEM Accelerator Program in the College of Science as well as the Director of COMPLETE (Center for Outreach in Mathematics Professional Learning and Educational Technology) at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. His research interests are in the broad areas of computational mathematics, scientific computing, computational biomechanics and STEM education. During the last decade, Dr. Seshaiyer initiated and directed a variety of educational programs including graduate and undergraduate research, K-12 outreach, teacher professional development, and enrichment programs to foster the interest of students and teachers in STEM at all levels. His research includes the development of new analytical techniques and efficient computational algorithms to obtain numerical solutions to differential equations describing multi-physics interactions. His research in Computational biomechanics includes developing, extending and applying mathematics for the purposes of better understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of the human vascular system. Integrated with the research plan is an education plan where the primary goal is to teach students and teachers at all levels to apply well-developed research concepts, to fundamental applications arising in STEM disciplines.

Thesis title: Motion Tracking Problems in Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Networking Romit Roy Choudhury, Director/Chair Nitin Vaidya Klara Nahrstedt Tarek Abdelzaher Bruce Maggs
Abstract: We consider the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem with partial feedback, minimizing a non-negative loss function using the graph based feedback framework introduced by Mannor and Shamir in 2011. We offer algorithms that attain small loss bounds, as well as low approximate regret against a shifting comparator. Classical learning algorithms add a low level of uniform noise to the algorithm‚Äôs choice to limit the variance of the loss estimator used in importance sampling, which also helps the algorithm to shift to a new arm fast enough when the comparator changes. However, such an approach poses significant hurdles to proving small-loss or low approximate regret bounds. We show that a different general technique of freezing arms, rather than adding random noise, does much better in this setting. The idea of freezing arms was proposed by Allenberg et al. in 2006 in the context of bandit learning with multiplicative weights. We show the broad applicability of this technique by extending it to partial information feedback (via a novel dual freezing thresholding technique), and to shifting comparators.

Abstract: The fields of AI and robotics have made great improvements in many individual subfields, including in motion planning, symbolic planning, reasoning under uncertainty, perception, and learning. Our goal is to develop an integrated approach to solving very large problems that are hopelessly intractable to solve optimally. We make a number of approximations during planning, including serializing subtasks, factoring distributions, and determinizing stochastic dynamics, but regain robustness and effectiveness through a continuous state-estimation and replanning process. I will describe our application of these ideas to an end-to-end mobile manipulation system, as well as ideas for current and future work on improving correctness and efficiency through learning.

Rapidly Exploring Random Life   This talk will reflect on Professor Steven M. LaValle's life and career development as a University of Illinois alumnus. Anecdotes and lessons learned as a student, professor, entrepreneur, and industry leader will be interspersed with some of his technical work in the areas of robotics and virtual reality. The talk will conclude with some thoughts about where industry, research, and education in virtual and augmented reality are heading, or at least ought to be heading.   Bio: Steven M. LaValle is one of the preeminent figures in robotics research, not only revolutionizing motion planning, but also blazing new trails in minimal sensing and virtual reality (VR).   LaValle‚Äôs groundbreaking contribution to motion planning, a basic operation in almost all robotics, is the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), which is included in top robotics libraries for use in autonomous vehicles, manufacturing, and humanoid robots. RRTs are also used for protein folding, drug design, automated video game characters, virtual prototyping, architecture, and digital acting.   LaValle has created novel solutions to common problems such as navigation, pursuit-evasion, target tracking, and surveillance, but with cheaper and simpler components than previously necessary. This work in minimal sensing was attractive to Oculus VR.   At Oculus VR, LaValle led the company‚Äôs research and development efforts. He holds a patent on perception-based tracking, crucial for reducing the Oculus Rift‚Äôs perceived tracking latency. A second patent covers sensor calibration and filtering methods, critical for accuracy and low-latency. Since returning to Illinois, he introduced CS498 "Virtual Reality," bringing his industry knowledge to the classroom. 

Please join us in recognizing these alumni and faculty whose contributions to the field have brought distinction to themselves, the department, and the university.

Knowing which part of a program processes which parts of an input can reveal the structure of the input as well as the structure of the program. In a URL "http://www.example.com/path/", for instance, the protocol ‚Äúhttp", the host ‚Äúwww.example.com", and the path ‚Äúpath" would be handled by different functions and stored in different variables. Given a set of sample inputs, we use _dynamic tainting_ to trace the data flow of each input character, and aggregate those input fragments that would be handled by the same function into lexical and syntactical entities. The result is a _context-free grammar_ that accurately reflects valid input structure; as it draws on function and variable names, it can be as readable as textbook examples:     URL ::= PROTOCOL "://" HOST "/" PATH   PROTOCOL ::= ‚Äúhttp‚Äù | ‚Äúhttps‚Äù | ‚Ä¶   HOST ::= /[a-zA-Z0-9.]+/   ...   We expect inferred grammars to considerably ease the understanding of file and input formats. Their most important use, however, will be in automatic fuzz testing, where grammars can easily be turned into producers that help to quickly cover program features. Our grammar-based LANGFUZZ fuzzer is in daily use at Mozilla and has uncovered more than 4,000 defects so far; mining grammars automatically will bring such techniques to a wide range of programs. For details on our work on grammar mining, see https://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/models/autogram/     Bio.

Abstract: What do we need in a practical program logic and tool for verifying C programs? It must support pointer data structures with sharing and mutation: separation logic is useful. It should facilitate the use of function pointers in such usage patterns as ‚Äúobjects‚Äù or ‚Äúclosures‚Äù: it should be higher-order. It should support data abstraction, especially in connection with objects and closures; that is, quantification over representation predicates.   Each program is verified in its own application domain, so the program logic should have strong facilities and libraries for reasoning in the mathematics of many application domains.  So the program logic be embedded in a general-purpose logic and proof assistant such as Coq.  Verifiable C is a higher-order concurrent separation logic for C, embedded in Coq, as part of the Verified Software Toolchain. It is proved sound with a machine-checked proof in Coq. It assists users in interactively building correctness proofs for their C programs. In this talk I will explain the requirements, design, implementation, and practical use of the Verified Software Toolchain.      Bio: Andrew W.

The big data boom in recent years covers a wide spectrum of heterogeneous data types, from text to image, video, speech, and multimedia. Most of the valuable information in such "big data" is encoded in natural language, which makes it accessible to some people‚Äîfor example, those who can read that particular language‚Äîbut much less amenable to computer processing beyond a simple keyword search.    My focused research area, cross-source Information Extraction (IE) on a massive scale, aims to create the next generation of information access in which humans can communicate with computers in any natural language beyond keyword search, and computers can discover accurate, concise, and trustable information embedded in big data from heterogeneous sources. The goal of IE is to extract structured facts from a wide spectrum of heterogeneous unstructured data types. Traditional IE techniques are limited to a certain source X (X = a particular language, domain, limited number of pre-defined fact types, single data modality, ...). When moving from X to a new source Y, we need to start from scratch again by annotating a substantial amount of training data and developing Y-specific extraction capabilities.    In this talk, I will present a new Universal IE paradigm to combine the merits of traditional IE (high quality and fine granularity) and Open IE (high scalability). This framework is able to discover schemas and extract facts from any input data in any domain, without any annotated training data or predefined schema, by combining distributional semantics and symbolic semantics. It can also be extended to thousands of languages and multiple data modalities (text, images, videos) by constructing a common semantic space and conducting transfer learning across sources. The resulting systems have won top performance at various NIST international research evaluations and been selected for DARPA and ARL demos and transitions.   Bio: Heng Ji is the Edward P.

Programmers tend to think of parallel programming as a problem of dividing up computation, but often the most difficult part is the placement and movement of data. As machines become more complex and hierarchical, describing what to do with the data is increasingly a first-class programming concern. Legion is a programming model and runtime system for describing hierarchical organizations of both data and computation at an abstract level. A separate mapping interface allows programmers to control how data and computation are placed onto the actual memories and processors of a specific machine. This talk will present the design of Legion, the novel issues that arise in both the design and implementation, and experience with applications.

The problem of implementing a secure program is an ideal problem domain for formal methods. In this talk, I will be using security as term that encompasses traditional security concepts and also privacy. Even a small error in the logic of a program can drastically weaken the security and privacy guarantees that it provides.   Existing work on applying formal methods to security has focused primarily on applying verification techniques to determine if an existing program satisfies a desired security guarantee. However, the challenge is to synthesize correct software from the outset. The key issue here is to balance security and functionality (a secure software that does nothing is easy to synthesize. Just do nothing:-))   In this talk, I will review some of the projects that I have worked on that balance the two competing requirements (i.e., security+privacy and functionality). I will then describe some interesting open problems along these lines.   Bio: Somesh Jha received his B.Tech from Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi in Electrical Engineering.

Somesh also received the NSF CAREER Award in 2005 and became an ACM Fellow in 2017.
Supporting interactive queries and analytics over large data is a critical requirement in many data-driven applications. The classic external memory model based on IO optimizations no longer works well in the era of big data due to its high latency. Instead, newer systems (e.g., Spark, Impala) rely on in-memory computing over a cluster of commodity machines to offer scale-out interactive data analytics.    In the context of large spatio-temporal data, this talk presents the Simba system that offers scalable and efficient in-memory analytics over a cluster. Simba extends the Spark SQL engine to support rich query and analytical semantics through both SQL and DataFrame API (e.g., spatial join, knn join, trajectories).   An effective query optimizer leveraging its indexing support and geometry-aware query optimization is designed. Furthermore, the system is able to provide online analytics that explores the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff through novel online aggregation techniques that support complex multi-way join queries and random sampling over joins. Lastly, we will also present ongoing extensions to Simba that explores spatio-temporal learning and sentiment analysis over large data.

Randomness is vital to cryptographic security. Pseudorandom number generation algorithms have been the topic of decades of academic study, and a variety of cryptographic pseudorandom number generation algorithms have been formally standardized over the years. However, in spite of these formal foundations and standards, cryptographic disasters stemming from flawed random number generator implementations happen with distressing frequency. We will tour several recent incidents of flawed and backdoored random number generators, trace these flaws to gaps in understanding between researchers, standards bodies, and implementers, and discuss implications for security and policy moving forward.

Abstract: Doing data science ‚Äì extracting insight by analyzing data ‚Äì is not easy. Data science is used to answer interesting questions that typically involve multiple diverse data sources, many different types of analysis, and often, large and messy data volumes. To answer one of these questions, several types of expertise may be needed to understand the context and domain being served, to import and transform individual data sets, to implement effective machine learning and/or statistical methods, to design and program applications and interfaces to extract and share data and insights, and to manage the data and systems used for analysis and storage.    The IBM Research Accelerated Discovery Lab studies how data scientists work, and uses the results to help them gain insights faster. In this talk, I will look at what has been learned to date, through user studies and experience with tens of analytics projects, and the environment that was built as a result. In particular, I will describe how our system captures information to enable contextual search, provenance queries, and other functionality to afford teams faster progress in data-intensive investigations. I will also touch on efforts to leverage data and people to explain what happens during an investigation, with an ultimate goal of moving from descriptive to prescriptive analytics in order to accelerate data science and the analytic process. I will illustrate these various efforts using an ambitious current project on applying metagenomics to food safety, and will conclude with a discussion of where more work is needed to accelerate ‚Äì and perhaps eventually, automate ‚Äì data science.

Abstract: Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are the buzzwords of today in research, industry and funding agencies as they are revolutionizing our work and daily lives. In this lecture, I will first give a brief introduction of industrial robots which have reduced the need for manual labour, then go through the work of mobile robots which have much wider outreach and larger operating space in comparison with industrial robots, and welcome the era of social robots which are becoming parts of the daily lives in education, healthcare, finance, entertainment, etc. I would like to conclude my lecture by discussing the fusion of AI and Robotics. For each of the subtopics, I will begin with an overview for a broader perspective, before delving into certain fundamental technical details and actual development examples. After a brief history of industrial and mobile robotics, I will focus more on the recent research works of social robotics which call for much higher demands in robot designs with artistic appeal, intelligent control with safety, scene understanding for better interaction and companionship, and among others. At this point of the time, the fusion of AI and robotics is apparent, and open for us to work together to make social robots as an integral part of our social fabric.

Abstract: For decades, Moore's Law dimensional scaling has been the fuel that propelled the computing industry forward, by delivering performance, power and cost advantages with each new generation of silicon. Today, these scaling benefits are slowing to a crawl. If the computing industry wants to continue to make scalability the primary source of value in tomorrow's computing systems, we will have to quickly find new and productive ways to scale future systems. In this talk, I will highlight my work and the work of others that is rejuvenating scaling through the application of heterogeneous parallel designs. Leveraging these technologies to solve the scaling problem will be a significant challenge, as future scalability success will ultimately be less about ‚Äúhow‚Äù to do it and more about ‚Äúhow much‚Äù will it cost.

Abstract: The security of any system relies on models and assumptions that attempt to capture potential adversarial behavior. Unfortunately, when faced with real world adversaries, these assumptions often become flaky, inaccurate or even completely incorrect. In this talk, I will show several examples of this gap between theoretical and real-world security.   First, I will present Spectre and Meltdown, two microarchitectural attacks that read protected OS kernel memory by exploiting speculative execution, a performance optimization typically performed by all modern CPUs. Second, I will show how to utilize unintentional physical side-channel leakage from complex computing devices in order to extract secret cryptographic keys. Finally, on the defensive side, I will show how to bridge theory and practice by discussing how to construct and deploy verifiable computation schemes for arbitrary C programs.   The talk will discuss cryptographic techniques and will include live demonstrations.

Abstract: How will self-driving cars change urban mobility? This talk describes both theoretical and scientific contributions in the field of reinforcement learning, combinatorial optimization, and convex optimization, presented in the context of enabling mixed-autonomy mobility, the gradual and complex integration of automated vehicles into the existing traffic system.   The talk first presents new contributions in mixed-autonomy traffic, which explore and quantify the potential impact of a small fraction of automated vehicles on low-level traffic flow dynamics, using novel techniques in model-free deep reinforcement learning. Second, the talk presents reinforcement learning techniques for improved variance reduction developed for the control of complex large-scale systems such as mixed-autonomy traffic presented in the first part. To anchor this work in a broader mobility planning perspective, recent theoretical contributions in convex and combinatorial optimization, which contribute to challenges in higher-level individual and aggregate decision making in mixed-autonomy mobility will then be presented in the third part of the talk. More generally, the continued and accelerating introduction of automation into society will generate widespread yet poorly understood externalities. Therefore, this talk concludes by proposing a multi-scale design paradigm for developing sustainable and reliable intelligent infrastructure, which extends the current methodology for building AI systems, and a taxonomy of critical challenges both in machine learning and modeling, needed to address growing problems created by rapid urbanization.

Abstract: There is a rising demand for high-performance 3D sensors in response to the rapid development of autonomous cars, 3D printers, and virtual/augmented reality systems. These sensors often make use of controllable light sources to send light signals into an environment, and cameras to measure the signal reflected back in response. This approach can, however, fail in critical scenarios where objects with complex material properties are present, when imaging objects under overwhelmingly bright sunlight, or when the object of interest is hidden behind an occluder.   In this talk, I will address these key challenges by presenting a new family of computational cameras that explicitly control what light paths contribute to an image. First, I will identify the crucial link between stereo geometry and light transport used to attenuate the contribution of multiply-scattered light paths which make 3D imaging hard. Second, I will show how this link can be further exploited to optimize the energy-efficiency of these camera systems, which enables 3D imaging under strong ambient lighting. Finally, I will explain how sampling a specific set of light paths leads to the derivation of an efficient, closed-form solution for reconstructing images of objects hidden from view.

Abstract: The big data boom in recent years covers a wide spectrum of heterogeneous data types, from text to image, video, speech, and multimedia. Most of the valuable information in such "big data" is encoded in natural language, which makes it accessible to some people ‚Äî for example, those who can read that particular language ‚Äî but much less amenable to computer processing beyond a simple keyword search. My focused research area, cross-source Information Extraction (IE) on a massive scale, aims to extract accurate, concise, and trustable information embedded in big data from heterogeneous sources, and thus create the next generation of information access in which humans can communicate with computers in any natural language.   Traditional IE approaches heavily relied on pre-defined schemas and a substantial amount of manual clean annotations for training, and thus they were limited to a certain domain, genre, language, and data modality. In this talk, I will present a new Universal IE paradigm to combine the merits of traditional IE (high quality and fine granularity) and Open IE (high scalability). This framework is able to discover schemas and extract facts from any input data in any domain, without any annotated training data or predefined schema, by combining distributional semantics and symbolic semantics. I will describe how to construct a common semantic space that is massively scalable across thousands of languages, multiple data modalities (text, images, videos), and sources. This common space is capable of representing knowledge elements at all scales from atomic entities to structured relations and events, conducting inference and transfering knowledge across sources. Because of this new paradigm, IE techniques, for the first time, can be extended from a dozen of knowledge types to thousands of types, from a few dominant languages to thousands of low-resource languages, from texts to multiple data modalities including images and videos, with higher quality and lower cost. The resulting systems have won top performance at various NIST international research evaluations for a decade and been selected for DARPA, ARL, AFRL, DTRA and FBI demos and transitions.

Abstract: While the big data revolution in the consumer, business, and social networks domains is widely known, a similar revolution is taking place in the sciences and engineering driven by high-throughput instrumentation. This talk will feature big data challenges in the life sciences, primarily due to advances in sequencing that resulted in several orders of magnitude throughput increases per unit cost during the last decade. These advances are democratizing big data generation capabilities and spawning new scientific inquiries that would not be feasible otherwise. High-throughput sequencers enable diverse applications, each requiring its own class of supporting algorithms. I will present an overview of my group‚Äôs research in addressing some of these issues through the development of efficient algorithms, high performance computing approaches, and community building efforts.

Abstract: Motion planning has application in robotics, animation, virtual prototyping and training, and even for seemingly unrelated tasks such as evaluating architectural plans or simulating protein folding. Surprisingly, sampling-based planning methods have proven effective on problems from all these domains. In this talk, we provide an overview of sampling-based planning and describe some variants developed in our group, including strategies suited for manipulation planning and for user interaction. For virtual prototyping, we show that in some cases a hybrid system incorporating both an automatic planner and haptic user input leads to superior results. Finally, we describe our application of sampling-based motion planners to simulate molecular motions, such as protein and RNA folding.    Bio: Nancy M.

Abstract: Computing is changing how we solve problems in all disciplines and is impacting all sectors of the economy and all aspects of daily life. At universities, booming enrollments and broad interest in computing across the campus are bringing exciting opportunities to establish new research collaborations and to create novel cross-disciplinary academic programs. These developments are causing universities to rethink how computing education is delivered and more broadly, how computing is situated in the institution. We need to strategically manage these opportunities, forming win-win academic and industrial partnerships. This includes developing innovative instructional models and technologies that enable us to meet the demand for computing education while still supporting faculty and graduate students to pursue our research. In this talk, we'll discuss strategies for capitalizing on the explosive interest in computing to explore foundational and emerging research directions, to scale and improve computing education, and to broaden participation in the field.

Abstract: Secure multi-party computation (MPC) is a powerful cryptographic tool that allows users to perform privacy-preserving computations on their collective data, without revealing anything about their data to each other. For many decades MPC was considered infeasible, but recent progress has made MPC significantly more practical to the point where it is attracting interest from government agencies as well as start-up companies.   I will survey the field of MPC, and then discuss my research aimed at making this technique more efficient, more robust, more scalable, and easier to use. In addition to new protocols, I will also describe EMP, an open-source toolkit I have developed that allows non-experts to apply MPC in real-world applications.

Abstract: Smart contracts are programs running on top of a cryptocurrency or blockchain. This has has recently emerged as an important new programming model. In the Ethereum cryptocurrency alone, smart contract programs directly control over $10B USB of virtual currency. Smart contracts show an exciting potential to automate business processes, reduce the need for trusted intermediaries, and enable disruptive applications like prediction markets and exchanges. However, the positive potential of smart contracts seems to be equally matched by new hazards and pitfalls. Programming errors and exploitable vulnerabilities have already led to the loss or thefts or hundreds of millions of dollars. This has led to a surge of interest in using PL and formal methods techniques to avoid errors and improve code trustworthiness. In this talk I‚Äôll give a short survey of the security failures of smart contracts and their underlying causes, as well as the state of adoption of techniques from PL/FM research communities. I‚Äôll suggest some differences between smart contracts and traditional programming models that pose new research challenges.

Abstract: Social systems are now fueled by algorithms that facilitate and control connections and information. Simultaneously, computational systems are now fueled by people -- their interactions, data, and behavior. Consequently, there is a pressing need to design new algorithms that are socially responsible in how they learn, and socially optimal in the manner in which they use information. In this talk, I will share some of my research efforts to address such problems at this interface of social and computational systems. I will first explain the emergence of bias in algorithmic decision making and present first steps towards developing a systematic framework to control biases in classical problems such as data summarization and personalization. I will then consider how crowdsourced information is used, and new mechanisms that can increase diversity in a way that improves user experiences. Together, this work leads to new algorithms that have the ability to alleviate bias and increase diversity while often simultaneously maintaining their theoretical or empirical performance with respect to the original metrics.

Abstract: Many modern machine learning problems are solved using complex over-parametrized models on large datasets and require scalable algorithms with low computation and memory complexity. This often leads to use of non-convex methods which do not necessarily come with computational/ statistical guarantees.     In this talk, we will explore the role of simple algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent, in optimizing non-convex functions, and leverage this to design efficient algorithms for a large and important class of machine learning problems: those involving the fitting of low-rank matrices to data. Later we will discuss a surprising role the local search methods play in implicitly regularizing the complexity of the over-parametrized models in problems involving both low rank matrices and deep neural networks.

Abstract: The field of computer graphics, specifically computational photography and rendering, has seen tremendous progress over the past decades and, as a result, is an essential part of the film, gaming, and camera industries. However, the current state-of-the-art algorithms use complex optimization systems with heuristic components, and thus, are typically slow and produce sub-optimal results. Deep learning has the potential to revolutionize computer graphics by modeling problems in a data-driven and systematic way. However, the major challenge in applying deep learning to synthesis applications, such as view synthesis and high dynamic range imaging, is the task complexity and lack of large scale training data.   In this talk, I show how to address these problems by incorporating the underlying physical process of these applications into deep learning. Instead of solving one complex problem with deep learning, which is often intractable, I propose to break it into two smaller sub-problems that are physically motivated and easier to learn on limited training data. Specifically, I propose a novel, general two-stage framework, which can be applied (with slight modifications) to a variety of problems, including light field image synthesis, high dynamic range image and video generation, and Monte Carlo denoising.

Abstract: Over the next few decades, we are going to transition to a new economy where highly complex, customizable products are manufactured on demand by flexible robotic systems. In many fields, this shift has already begun. 3D printers are revolutionizing production of metal parts in the aerospace, automotive, and medical industries. Whole-garment knitting machines allow automated production of complex apparel and shoes. Manufacturing electronics on flexible substrates makes it possible to build a whole new range of products for consumer electronics and medical diagnostics. Collaborative robots, such as Baxter from Rethink Robotics, allow flexible and automated assembly of complex objects. Overall, these new machines enable batch-one manufacturing of products that have unprecedented complexity.   In my talk, I argue that the field of computational design is essential for the next revolution in manufacturing. To build increasingly functional, complex and integrated products, we need to create design tools that allow their users to efficiently explore high-dimensional design spaces by optimizing over a set of performance objectives that can be measured only by expensive computations. I will discuss how to overcome these challenges by 1) developing data-driven methods for efficient exploration of these large spaces and 2) performance-driven algorithms for automated design optimization based on high-level functional specifications. I will showcase how these two concepts are applied by developing new systems for designing robots, drones, and furniture. I will conclude my talk by discussing open problems and challenges for this emerging research field.

Abstract: The decentralized cryptocurrency Bitcoin popularized the notion of permissionless consensus. Bitcoin's solution, now known as the Nakamoto consensus, is to build a proof-of-work (PoW) chain and treat the longest PoW chain as consensus decisions. However, this elegant solution does have limitations. In this talk, I will present techniques to improve consensus protocols on multiple fronts.   A primary drawback of Nakamoto consensus is its long latency to confirm transactions. In contrast, the classical permissioned Byzantine consensus commits consensus decisions instantly. I will present Solida, a permissionless consensus protocol based on reconfigurable Byzantine consensus. I will then present an improved protocol for synchronous and authenticated Byzantine consensus, which tolerates 1/2 malicious participants and runs in expected 4 rounds (compared to expected 24 rounds from best prior work). Finally, Bitcoin‚Äôs hash-based PoW has raised concerns about fairness and energy consumption. I will describe my work on bandwidth-hard functions and proofs of space to address these concerns.

Abstract: The current framework of large-scale A/B testing in the tech industry has several drawbacks. Firstly, the tests are often continuously monitored without correcting for the resulting inflation in the false alarm rate. Secondly, the number of samples used in the experiment grows linearly with the number of options being tested, independent of the quality of the options. Lastly, running hundreds or thousands of such tests artificially inflates the apparent number of significant discoveries, and companies have no idea what proportion of their discoveries are spurious.   We propose a new framework as an alternative to existing setups for controlling false alarms across multiple A/B tests, and tackles all three aforementioned issues. It combines ideas from pure exploration for best-arm identification in multi-armed bandits (MAB), with online false discovery rate (FDR) control. This framework has various applications, including pharmaceutical companies testing a control pill against a few treatment options, to internet companies testing their current default webpage (control) versus many alternatives (treatment). Our setup allows running a (possibly infinite) sequence of best-arm MAB instances, and controlling the overall FDR of the process in a fully online manner. We adapt existing theory from both the MAB and online FDR literature to ensure that our framework comes with strong sample-optimality guarantees, as well as control of the power and (a modified) FDR at any time.

Abstract: Intelligent robots require advanced vision capabilities to perceive and interact with the real physical world. While computer vision has made great strides in recent years, its predominant paradigm still focuses on analyzing image pixels to infer 2D output representations (bounding boxes, segmentation, etc.), which remain far from sufficient for real-world robotics applications.   In this talk, I will advocate the use of complete 3D scene representations that enable intelligent systems to not only recognize what is seen (e.g. Am I looking at a chair?), but also predict contextual information about the complete 3D environment beyond visible surfaces (e.g. What could be behind the table? Where should I look to find an exit?). As examples, I will present a line of my recent works that demonstrate the power of these representations through amodal 3D object detection (Sliding Shape and Deep Sliding Shapes), analyzing and synthesizing 3D scenes (Semantic Scene Completion), and predicting semantic and 3D structure outside the image field of view (Im2Pano3D). Finally, I will discuss some ongoing efforts on how these 3D scene representations can further enable and benefit from real-world robotic interactions (in the Amazon Robotic Challenge), shifting the way we view computer vision problems from the perspective of a passive observer to that of an active explorer.

Abstract: Data curation (ingest, transformation, cleaning, schema mapping, deduplication, and consolidation) of raw data sets consumes up to 80% of a data scientist‚Äôs time. Integrating silos of enterprise data is also a major challenge to business users. To address these issues, we have built an end-to- end data curation system, Data Civilizer, in cooperation with the Qatar Computing Research Institute.   In this talk, I will briefly introduce the Data Civilizer system. Then I will discuss two of the components that I have constructed. First, I will discuss entity consolidation in Data Civilizer. This module accepts a collection of clusters of records thought to represent the same entity (i.e. duplicates) and merges each cluster into a single ‚Äúgolden‚Äù record. Next, I will show how to address the key challenges to enable scalable entity matching in Data Civilizer. Finally, I will conclude the talk with my future vision on data curation for end-users, and massive data lake management.

Abstract: Almost all of human knowledge is now available online, but the vast majority of it is principally encoded in the form of human language explanations.   In this talk, I explore novel neural network approaches that open up opportunities for getting a deep understanding of natural language text. First, I show how distributed representations enabled the building of a smaller, faster and more accurate dependency parser for finding the structure of sentences. Then I show how related neural technologies can be used to improve the construction of knowledge bases from text. However, maybe we don't need this intermediate step and can directly gain knowledge and answer people's questions from large textbases? In the third part, I explore this possibility by directly reading text with a simple yet highly effective neural architecture for question answering.

Abstract: The vast quantities of language data that capture diverse aspects of human behavior offer tremendous opportunities for machine learning and language technologies to gain insights about society. In this talk, I show how natural language processing techniques can be expanded from understanding the meanings of words and sentences to inferring the underlying social structures and processes they reflect. In so doing, we can identify and intervene in crucial societal issues. I apply these techniques to computationally detect two ways in which the social context affects language use: 1) social relations affecting how individuals interact with one another, and 2) social constructs shaping how institutions interact with communities.   First, I show how to computationally detect various manifestations of power in workplace interactions between individuals ‚Äî providing means to study the effects of incivility in those settings. Second, I show how to computationally investigate the ways race shapes the interactions between the police and the communities they serve ‚Äî providing means for law enforcement to address and monitor racial disparities in policing. Finally, I talk about how these methods can be expanded to address broader issues such as incivility in online interactions. My research looks beyond words and phrases and introduces ways to extract the richer rhetorical and dialog aspects of interactions, and demonstrates the importance of such in-depth language processing for the computational social sciences.  Bio: Vinodkumar Prabhakaran is a postdoctoral fellow in the computer science department at Stanford University. His research falls in the interdisciplinary field of computational social sciences, with a focus on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Social Good. He brings together NLP techniques, machine learning models, and social science methods to identify and address large scale societal issues such as racial bias and disparities, workplace incivility, and abusive behavior online. In his doctoral thesis, he studied how NLP techniques can help detect the underlying social power structures that guide social interactions. In his current research, he builds computational techniques to study racial disparities in various conversational aspects such as respect, politeness, and conversational structure within police interactions during traffic stops. His work has been published in computer science conferences such as ACL, NAACL, and EMNLP, as well as in high-impact multidisciplinary journals such as the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). His co-authored work on racial disparities in officer respect during traffic stops was awarded the prestigious PNAS Cozzarelli price for 2017.  https://www.cs.stanford.edu/~vinod/
Abstract: We are at an exciting point in the evolution of memory technology. Device manufacturers have created a new non-volatile memory (NVM) technology that can serve as both system memory and storage. NVM supports fast reads and writes similar to volatile memory, but all writes to it are persistent like a solid-state disk. The advent of NVM invalidates decades of design decisions that are deeply embedded in today's database management systems (DBMSs). These systems are unable to take full advantage of NVM because their internal architectures are predicated on the assumption that memory is volatile. With NVM, many of the components of today's DBMSs are unnecessary and will degrade the performance of data-intensive applications. Thus, the best way to resolve these shortcomings is by designing a new system explicitly tailored for NVM.   In this talk, I will present my research on the design and development of an NVM DBMS, called Peloton. Peloton's architecture shows that the impact of NVM spans across all the layers of the DBMS. I will first introduce write-behind logging, an NVM-centric protocol that improves the availability of the database system by two orders-of-magnitude compared to the widely-used write-ahead logging protocol. I will then present the BzTree, an NVM-centric index data structure that illustrates how to simplify programming on NVM. In drawing broader lessons from this work, I will argue that all types of software systems, including file systems, machine-learning systems, and key-value stores, are amenable to similar architectural changes to achieve high performance and availability on NVM.

Abstract: A key component of intelligent behavior in robots is motion planning, which asks to generate continuous motions to achieve specified tasks while respecting constraints. This talk introduces recent achievements and research directions in optimal motion planning. It then proceeds beyond algorithms for solving single problem instances to seek a deeper understanding of the global structure of families of related problems. Armed with this global understanding, we can design algorithms that reason about changes to constraints, plan simultaneously across spaces of problem instances, or use adapt experience between problems. These approaches lead to faster and higher quality plans, which are in some cases fast enough to be suitable for inner loops of feedback controllers. Moreover, global structure can be embedded into machine learning models that learn optimal controllers with substantially higher accuracy than black box approaches (e.g., deep neural networks). This research has been inspired and informed by projects on a diverse range of robot systems, including mobile manipulators, humanoids, legged robots, warehouse automation, and autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: While some experimental biologists view bioinformatics as a servant, I argue that it is rapidly turning into the queen of molecular biology. I will illustrate this view by showing how some recent computational developments brought down biological dogmas that remained unchallenged for at least three decades.    In the second part of the talk, I will discuss a century-old dogma about the traditional classroom and describe the recent efforts to repudiate it using Intelligent Tutoring Systems. I will describe a new educational technology called a Massive Adaptive Interactive Text (MAIT) that can prevent individual learning breakdowns and outperform a professor in a classroom. I will argue that computer science is a unique discipline where the transition to MAITs is about to happen and will describe a bioinformatics MAIT that has already outperformed me. In difference from existing Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs), MAITs will capture digitized individual learning paths of all students and will transform educational psychology into a digital science. I will argue that the future MAIT revolution will profoundly affect the way we all teach and will generate large population-wide datasets containing individual learning paths through various MAITs.

Abstract: How to enable fast deep learning is a key problem in AI research nowadays. In this talk, I will approach it from two perspectives: models and algorithms. Firstly, I will propose a model, LSTM-Jump, that can skip unimportant information in sequential data, mimicking the skimming behavior of human reading. Trained with an efficient reinforcement learning algorithm, this model can be several times faster than a vanilla LSTM in inference time. Then I will introduce a sequence encoding model that discards recurrent networks, which thus fully supports parallel training and inference. Based on this technique, a new question-answering model, QANet, is proposed. Combined with data augmentation approach via cyclic-translation, this model achieves No.1 performance in the competitive Stanford Question and Answer Dataset (SQuAD), while being times faster than the prevalent models. Lastly, I will talk about a general gradient normalization technique for efficient deep networks training. This method can not only alleviate the gradient vanishing problem, but also regularize the model to achieve better generalization.

Abstract: Deep learning is one of most popular learning techniques used in natural language processing (NLP). A central question in deep learning for NLP is how to design a neural network that can fully utilize the information from training data and make accurate predictions. A key to solve this problem is to design a better network architecture.   In this talk, I will present two examples from my work on how structural information from natural language helps design better neural network models. The first example shows adding coreference structures of entities not only helps different aspects of text modeling, but also improves the performance of language generation; the second example demonstrates structures of organizing sentences into coherent texts can help neural networks build better representations for various text classification tasks. Along the lines of this topic, I will also propose some ideas for future work and discuss the potential challenges.

Domains such as law, healthcare, and public policy often involve highly consequential decisions which are predominantly made by human decision-makers. The growing availability of data pertaining to such decisions offers an unprecedented opportunity to develop machine learning models which can aid human decision-makers in making better decisions. However, the applicability of machine learning to the aforementioned domains is limited by certain fundamental challenges:   1) The data is selectively labeled i.e., we only observe the outcomes of the decisions made by human decision-makers and not the counterfactuals. 2) The data is prone to a variety of selection biases and confounding effects. 3) The successful adoption of the models that we develop depends on how well decision-makers can understand and trust their functionality, however, most of the existing machine learning models are primarily optimized for predictive accuracy and are not very interpretable.    In this talk, I will describe novel computational frameworks which address the aforementioned challenges, thus, paving the way for large-scale deployment of machine learning models to address problems of significant societal impact. First, I will discuss how to build interpretable predictive models and explanations of complex black box models which can be readily understood and consequently trusted by human decision-makers. I will then outline efficient and provably near-optimal approximation algorithms to solve these problems. Next, I will present a novel evaluation framework which allows us to reliably compare the quality of decisions made by human decision-makers and machine learning models amidst challenges such as missing counterfactuals and presence of unmeasured confounders (unobservables). Lastly, I will provide a brief overview of my research on diagnosing and characterizing biases (systematic errors) in human decisions and predictions of machine learning models.    I will conclude the talk by sketching future directions which enable effective and efficient collaboration between humans and machine learning models to address problems of societal impact.

Abstract: Joins are expensive, especially on large data and/or multiple relations. One promising approach in mitigating their high costs is to just return a simple random sample of the full join results, which is sufficient for many tasks. Indeed, in as early as 1999, Chaudhuri et al. posed the problem of sampling over joins as a fundamental challenge in large database systems. They also pointed out a fundamental barrier for this problem, that the sampling operator cannot be pushed through a join, i.e., sample(R) ‚ñ∑‚óÅsample(S) does not yield sample(R ‚ñ∑‚óÅ S).  To overcome this barrier, they used precomputed statistics to guide the sampling process, but only showed how this works for two-relation joins.   This talk revisits this classic problem for both acyclic and cyclic multi-way joins. We demonstrate how to perform sampling over joins effectively and efficiently for different use-case scenarios. We start with a novel technique that is able to produce independent but non-uniform samples, and show its usefulness for the classic problem of online aggregation. We then extend this technique and we propose a general framework for random sampling over multi-way joins (a random sample consists of samples that are both independent and uniform). We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed technique for different applications, including interactive analytics and learning over joins. We analyze the properties of different instantiations of our framework and evaluate them against the baseline methods.

Abstract: Networks not only appear in many high-impact application domains, but also have become an indispensable ingredient in a variety of data mining and machine learning problems. Often these networks are collected from different sources, at different time, at different granularities. State-of- the-art focuses on mining networks at three complementary levels, including the network-level at the coarsest granularity, the subgraph-level in the middle, and node/link-level at the finest granularity. In other words, an individual node or link is often the finest-granulated object (i.e., the atom) in a network mining model and algorithm.   In this talk, I will present our recent work on mining multiple inter-correlated networks, that allows us to go deeper inside a node or a link of a network, i.e., to model and mine networks hidden inside an atom (i.e., a node or a link). First, I will introduce a new data model for a network of networks, where the key idea is to leverage the network itself as a context to connect different networks. Second, I will present some algorithmic examples on how to perform mining with a network of networks, where the key idea is to leverage the contextual network as an effective regularizer during the mining process, including ranking and clustering. We believe that the power and beauty of networks of networks lie in thinking of networks as a context, and this vision (networks-as- a-context) goes well beyond network data. To demonstrate that, I will further introduce our other work on how to use networks as a powerful and unifying context to connect different types of data from different sources with different data mining algorithms, including a network of co-evolving time series, a network of regression models, a network of inference problems and a network of control problems. Finally, I will share my thoughts about the future plan, including how networks-as- a-context can help in the era of big data and AI.

Can we provably immunize protocols against coordinated attacks on the internet? Can we verify that computation is performed correctly while preserving the privacy of underlying data? Can we enable mutually distrusting participants to securely compute on distributed private data? These are some of the core challenges that lie at the heart of modern cryptography and secure protocol design.   In this talk, I will discuss my research that builds non-interactive secure protocols to address these challenges based on widely believed cryptographic hardness assumptions.   I will present new techniques that reimagine proofs of security to overcome known barriers and enable protocols that were previously believed to be impossible. These lay the foundations for preventing man-in-the-middle attacks, building variants of zero-knowledge proofs, and achieving other key cryptographic properties while for the first time, requiring only a single message from each participant.

Thesis title: Actor Programming with Static Guarantees Thesis committee: Gul Agha, Director/Chair Elsa Gunter Madhusudan Parthasarathy Antonio Ravara
Programming‚Äîthe means by which we tell computers what to do‚Äîhas changed a lot over time. Programming today means programming alongside hundreds of fellow students, thousands of fellow professional software engineers at a particular company, or millions of fellow developers in the open-source community sharing their code online. In this talk, I will describe several interactive systems I have built that exploit the structure within large volumes of peer-produced code to help communities of programmers learn about, reflect on, and teach how to write more correct, readable code.   These systems are made possible by code demography, which I define as statistics, algorithms, and visualizations that help people comprehend and interact with population-level structure and trends in large code corpora. The key to my approach is designing or inferring abstractions that capture critical features and abstract away variation that is irrelevant to the user. Code demography can reveal strategically diverse sets of aligned code examples which, according to theories of human concept learning, help people learn, i.e., construct mental abstractions that generalize well.   I will focus this talk on systems that use program analysis, program synthesis, and visualization to power active data-driven teaching in large programming classrooms and passive knowledge sharing within developer communities. As a result of integrating my systems into the course infrastructure of UC Berkeley‚Äôs largest introductory programming class (>1500 students), the teaching staff required to give composition feedback to the entire class have dropped from 35-40 to only 4-5 teachers. I will conclude with my vision for how the techniques of code demography can be generalized to more types of large complex data corpora and enable new data-driven programming paradigms.

Five additional fears are a result of the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù. I then conclude with ‚Äúthe big enchilada‚Äù, which is a pair of fears. In each case, I indicate what I think is the best way to deal with the current situation.   Bio: Dr. Stonebraker has been a pioneer of data base research and technology for more than forty years.

Abstract: Personal tracking technology has made it easier for people to better understand themselves and their routines around exercise, eating, finances, and more. This self-knowledge can serve as a first step toward changing behaviors, increasing awareness, or simply satisfying a curiosity. Though some people succeed in achieving their goals, most encounter a fundamental barrier: the design principles used in tracking technology assume people are highly motivated, unwavering in their diligence, and have the expertise necessary to analyze their data.   In this talk, I will demonstrate how the design of tracking technology can be improved to help people overcome two challenges: (1) helping people find value in their tracking, and (2) helping people find support through their tracking. I will present generalizable opportunities for designs to overcome these challenges through a conceptual model and framework, and will describe four novel systems which evaluate design strategies that are uncovered by these opportunities. The novel systems demonstrate how designs can better surface interesting and actionable insights from data, support people after they have lapsed in tracking, help people create interesting shareable content from their tracked data, and scaffold an interested audience with which to share. I will conclude by discussing opportunities I am excited to explore in the future, including supporting the decision to track and the tool selection process, enabling opportunistic storytelling through tracked data, and developing more inclusive tracking technologies.

Parallel computers have come of age and need parallel software to justify their usefulness. There are two major avenues to get programs to run in parallel: parallelizing compilers and parallel languages and/or libraries. In this talk, we present our results using both approaches and draw some conclusions about their relative effectiveness and potential.   First, we describe the Hybrid Analysis (HA) compiler framework that can seamlessly integrate static and run-time analysis of memory references into a single framework capable of full automatic loop level parallelization. Experimental results on 26 benchmarks show full program speedups superior to those obtained by the Intel Fortran compilers.   Next, we present the Standard Template Adaptive Parallel Library (STAPL) based approach to write parallel code. STAPL is a collection of generic data structures and algorithms that provides a high productivity, parallel programming infrastructure analogous to the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). In this talk, we provide an overview of the major STAPL components with particular emphasis on graph algorithms. We then present scalability results of real codes using petascale machines such as IBM BG/Q and Cray. Finally, we present some of our ideas for future work in this area.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is common across many high-impact application domains, ranging from national security to air traffic modeling, manufacturing, and healthcare. It is at the core of the 'Variety' aspect of big data. Such heterogeneity can be present in a variety of forms, including (1) task heterogeneity, where multiple related learning tasks can be jointly learned to improve the overall performance; (2) view heterogeneity, where complementary information is available from various sources; (3) oracle heterogeneity, where multiple oracles may have different opinions regarding the true label of an example; and (4) instance heterogeneity, where a single example can be decomposed into a set of instances with heterogeneous labels.    In this talk, I will present our recent work towards building a unified framework for learning from such data heterogeneity, focusing on the co-existence of multiple types of data heterogeneity such as task and oracle dual heterogeneity. The goal is to enable the learning model to enjoy the best of all possible worlds. In particular, I will hinge on the application of accident phase classification in air traffic modeling, discuss the problem-specific data heterogeneity, and our proposed tensor-based model for learning from such data heterogeneity, together with empirical results on various data sets. Finally, I will conclude the talk by sharing my vision for heterogeneous learning in the future.

Abstract: Data structures have applications and connections to algorithm design, database systems, streaming algorithms and other areas of computer science. Understanding what efficient data structures can do (and what they cannot do) is crucial to these applications. In this talk, I will present my work in analyzing efficient data structures and proving what they cannot accomplish. I will focus on the recent development in building new connections between dynamic data structures and communication complexity, as well as a new approach to analyzing dynamic data structures with Boolean outputs and super-logarithmic time.
